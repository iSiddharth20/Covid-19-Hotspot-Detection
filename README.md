# Covid-19-Hotspot-Detection

The project aims at identifying cities in each state of India where the number of cases is maximum and list those cities as Hotspots of the State. 

Identification of such hotspots is done through Two Approaches, including Mathematical Approach and Visual Representation Approach so as to cross verify the obtained results and avoid any discrepancy in results.

As a proof of concept, in the presented work, Three majorly affected States of India namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have been chosen to showcase the effectiveness of the concept. Due to personal attachment to the state, Madhya Pradesh has also been taken in this cluster.
